# 1.Description
---
The bench vise is a tool used to hold pieces to keep them firm and fixed meanwhile they are subjeted to secondary process, usually cleaning or filing.

The tool is fixed in a firm table or smooth suface.

In this design consists of a base, slide type. On this a vise slides on it using a screw. This screw adjusts by spinning on the place to give the bench vise the wished opening and a firm hold on the piece.

For the tool is recomended to buy it, that follows the dimenssions written below.

If a screw of that dimensions is not found, this archive has a 3D modeling, but the printing process has to be slow and with care, but a perfect termination might not be accomplished. Mistakes ar inevitable. To make the printing process more accurate it is advasided to use an extension on the program for making supports.

The design presented corresponds to a bench vise, which has an opening of 120 (mm) max. The bench vise is meant for personal use, on light and small pieces.

For the printing process, it was used a temperature of 60°C (plate) to 200°C (working temperature) and a filament size of 1,75 mm.

# 4.Printing time and weight
***

In the following section, the different times of printing that it took to make every piece, and their weight.

<div align="center">

|Part|Time [hours]|Weight [grams]|
|---|---|---|
|Jaw|1:28:32|35|
|Screw|2:20:54|31|
|Base|5:07:17|129|

# 5.Assembling description
***

After the printing process, a problem ocurred with the base and screw, becausethe first one had problems of adhension, the contorn of the piece had loose parts. The internal thread for the screw was not made correctly.

It is recomended to print the piece in a different orientation, adding supports in the zones with risk of little adhesion.

In the case of the screw, there were problems with the thread, for this reason it was decided to reemplaze it with a steel screw, wich was mechanized using a lathe.

The ensamble is very simple, since thee's only three pieces that conform the vise jaw.

The screw must pass through the base thread. The smaller diameter section of the screw is connected to the jaw through a set screw, which is inserted into the top of the jaw.
